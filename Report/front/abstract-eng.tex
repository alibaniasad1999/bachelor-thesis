	In this research, a method based on game theory has been used. In this method, two main players, system and disturbance, are considered. Each of the two players tries to increase their score with the lowest cost, which is considered here, the status of the players' score. In this method, the selection of the move is done using the Nash equilibrium, whose purpose is to reduce the cost function assuming the worst move of the other player. This method is resistant to input disturbance. It also has good resistance to modeling uncertainty. The presented method has been used to control a quadcopter three degree of freedom stand, which is also a kind of inverted pendulum. To evaluate the performance of this method, first simulations have been performed in the Simulink environment and then, by implementing it, the correctness of its performance has been confirmed.
