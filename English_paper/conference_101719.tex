\begin{abstract}
	The accurate attitude control of a quadrotor is necessary, especially when facing disturbance. In this study, a linear quadratic with integral action based on the differential game theory is implemented on a quadrotor experimental setup. A continuous state-space model of the setup is derived using the linearization of nonlinear equations of motion,
	and its parameters are identified with the experimental results.
	Then, the attitude control commands of the quadrotor are derived based on two players; one finds the best attitude control command, and the other creates the disturbance by mini-maximizing a quadratic criterion, defined as the sum of outputs plus the weighted control effort and disturbance. The performance of the proposed structure is investigated in level flight and compared to the linear quadratic regulator controller. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach has an excellent performance in dissipating the disturbances.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent A quadrotor is a type of helicopter with four rotors that plays a significant role in today's society, including research, military, imaging, recreation, and agriculture. The performance of the quadrotor relies on the control system, including attitude, altitude, and position subsystems. In the attitude control of the quadrotor, it is vital to maintain the attitude outputs at the desired level using control commands such as the rotational speed of the rotors, when the disturbances occur suddenly. Therefore, much research is being conducted on the automatic control of the attitudes' quadrotor in facing the disturbance.


     In \cite{PID}, a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is used to regulate the quadrotor attitude. However, the control objectives have not been effectively achieved with this controllers when the disturbance occurs. To solve this problem the model-based approaches \cite{model_base} are utilized for controller design. These controllers work based on information from the quadrotor's attitude model and disturbance to produce the best control command.


     Various model-based controllers can be found within the literature, the most well-known of which are intelligent control, the nonlinear control, robust control, and optimal control to reduce the disturbance effect in the attitude control and provide a faster control algorithm in facing the modeling error. In the intelligent controller category, the artificial intelligence computing approaches like fuzzy logic \cite{fuzzy}, iterative learning \cite{iterative_Learning}, machine learning \cite{machine_learning}, reinforcement learning \cite{Reinforcement_Learning}, and evolutionary computation \cite{Evolutionary} have been utilized to regulate the quadrotor's attitude.


     Moreover, nonlinear control methods such as  Feedback Linearization (FBL) \cite{FBL} and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) \cite{SMC} have been applied to control the roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the quadrotor. In the optimal controller category, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) \cite{LQR} and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) \cite{LQG} have been implemented on the quadrotor based on the minimization of a quadratic criterion, including regulation performance and control effort to provide optimally controlled feedback gains. 


     Linear Quadratic Regulator Differential Game (LQR-DG) control approach \cite{LQDG, robust_LQDG} is a class of optimal and robust controller methods that controls the outputs of a system based on its linear model and mini-maximization of a cost function. This approach has been utilized to stabilize and control various nonlinear and complex systems such as a ship controller \cite{LQDG_ship}. Moreover, in the LQR-DG control method, the control commands are analytically generated based on a pursuit-evasion of two players, one tracks the best control command, and the other creates the disturbance. This is one of the distinctive features of the LQR-DG controller and an important difference from other optimal control methods.


     In this study, an LQR controller method based on the differential game theory, with an integral action called Linear Quadratic Integral Regulator Differential Game (LQIR-DG) controller, is proposed to generate the most efficient control command for an experimental setup of the quadrotor when facing the disturbance. Since the LQIR-DG is affected by an accurate model of the system, first, the dynamic of the three-degree-of-freedom setup of the quadrotor is modeled. Then, the linear state-space form the quadrotor model is extracted using the linearization of the nonlinear equations of motion to utilize in the proposed control problem. Moreover, the model's parameters are identified and verified against the experimental values. Next, the LQIR-DG technique is applied to the experimental setup of the quadrotor to reduce the effect of disturbance. The performance of the suggested controller is examined when the disturbance occurs. The results show the successful performance of the LQIR-DG scheme in reducing the disturbance.


In the remainder of this study, the problem
 is defined in section \ref{sec:problem_statement}. The dynamics model for the experimental setup of the quadrotor is derived in details,  in section \ref{sec:modeling}. In section \ref{sec: diff game}, The LQIR-DG architecture is denoted. Finally, in sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:conclusion}, Numerical results and conclusion are provided, respectively.
	% In section \ref{sec:results}, numerical results are presented.
\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem_statement}
\noindent Here, a nonlinear dynamic is presented for the setup of the quadrotor, as illustrated in \figurename{\ref{quadlab}}.
The quadrotor is free to rotate about its roll, pitch, and yaw axes. The Euler angles and angular velocities along three orthogonal axes are measured simultaneously using the Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS). These noisy measurements are utilizes in the LQIR-DG for control of the Euler angles.
The block diagram of the controller structure is illustrated in \figurename{\ref{block_diagram}}.

\section{Modeling of the Quadrotor  Setup}\label{sec:modeling}
\noindent Here, the model of the three-degree-of-freedom setup of the quadrotor is presented in details.
% Here, the model of the quadrotor's experimental setup with three degrees of freedom is provided in detail.
For this purpose, first, the configuration of the quadrotor is denoted. Then, the nonlinear model of the attitude dynamics is derived to denote the state-space form. Finally, the nonlinear model is linearized to utilize in the control purposes.
\subsection{Configuration of the Quadrotor}
\noindent  \figurename{\ref{QuadAssum}} denotes the quadrotor schematic.
% Figure 3 provides the quadrotor's schematic.
Each rotor has an angular velocity ,$\Omega_i$, rotating about the $z_B$ axis in the body coordinate system.
% Each rotor, seen as a rigid disk, rotates with an angular velocity of $\Omega_i$ around the axis $z_B$ in the body-fixed frame.
Rotors 1 and 3 rotate counterclockwise, while rotors 2 and 4 rotate clockwise, to cancel yawing moment.
% To eliminate the quadrotor's yawing moment, rotors 1 and 3 revolve counterclockwise while rotors 2 and 4 rotate in the opposite direction, or clockwise.

\subsection{Dynamic Model}
\noindent The quadrotor kinetic model, derived using the Newton-Euler method, is stated as  \cite{b15}, \cite{b16}
% The Newton-Euler method, used to derive the dynamic model of the quadrotor, yields the following results
	\begin{align}
		&\dot p = \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}} qr + q \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{rotor}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}}\Omega_r + \dfrac{u_{\text{roll}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{roll}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}}
		\\
	&\dot q = \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}} rp + p \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{rotor}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}}\Omega_r + \dfrac{u_{\text{pitch}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{pitch}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}}
	\\
	&\dot r = \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}} pq  +  \dfrac{u_{\text{yaw}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{yaw}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}
	\end{align}
where $(p, q, r)$ are the angular velocities. $d_{\text{roll}}$, $d_{\text{pitch}}$, and $d_{\text{yaw}}$ are the disturbances, generated in $x_B$, $y_B$ and $z_B$, respectively. Moreover, $\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}$, $\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}$, and $\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}$ are the principal moment of inertia and $\mathrm{I}_{\text{rotor}}$ is a rotor  inertia  about its axis.
% The angular velocities are (p, q, r), while the roll, pitch, and yaw angles are (,).
The relation between the angular body rates and the Euler angles rates are obtained as
% The following is how the Euler angles rates and angular body rates are related:
\begin{align}
		\dot\phi &= p + (q\sin(\phi) + r\cos(\phi))\tan(\theta)\\
	\dot \theta &= q\cos(\phi) - r\sin(\phi)\\
	\dot\psi &= (q\sin(\phi) + r\cos(\phi))/{\cos(\theta)}\\
\end{align}
where $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$ are roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
Moreover, $\Omega_r$, called the overall residual rotor angular velocity, is computed as
% Or is referred to as the overall residual propeller angular speed , is computed as
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_r = -\Omega_1 + \Omega_2 - \Omega_3 + \Omega_4
\end{equation}
\subsection{Control Commands}
\noindent The control inputs $u_{\text{roll}}$, $u_{\text{pitch}}$, and $u_{\text{yaw}}$ are roll, pitch, and yaw moments, obtained from the rotors, defined as
% The roll, pitch, and yaw moments produced by the propellers are the control inputs u1, u2, and u3.
\begin{align}
		&u_{\text{roll}} = \mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}} (\Omega_2^2 - \Omega_4^2)\\
	&u_{\text{pitch}} = \mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}} (\Omega_1^2 - \Omega_3^2) \\
	&u_{\text{yaw}} = \mathrm{d} (\Omega_1^2 - \Omega_2^2 + \Omega_3^2 - \Omega_4^2)\\
\end{align}

Also, d and b are, respectively, drag and thrust coefficients. $\mathrm{d}_{\text{cg}}$ is the distance of rotors from the gravity center . Hence, the angular velocity commands are obtained as
\begin{align}
		\Omega_{c, 1}^2 &= \Omega_{\text{mean}}^2 + \dfrac{1}{2\mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}}}u_{\text{pitch}} + \dfrac{1}{4d}u_{\text{yaw}} \\
	\Omega_{c, 2}^2 &= \Omega_{\text{mean}}^2 + \dfrac{1}{2\mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}}}u_{\text{roll}} - \dfrac{1}{4d}u_{\text{yaw}}\\
	\Omega_{c, 3}^2 &= \Omega_{\text{mean}}^2 - \dfrac{1}{2\mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}}}u_{\text{pitch}} + \dfrac{1}{4d}u_{\text{yaw}} \\
\Omega_{c, 4}^2 &= \Omega_{\text{mean}}^2 - \dfrac{1}{2\mathrm{b\,d}_{\text{cg}}}u_{\text{roll}} - \dfrac{1}{4d}u_{\text{yaw}}
\end{align}
where $\Omega_{\text{mean}}$ is the nominal of the rotor angular velocities.
\subsection{State-Space Form}
\noindent Here, the state-space model is presented for the control purposes.
% For control purposes, the state-space model of the quadrotor experimental setup is described.
By defining $x_1 = p$, $x_2 = q$, $x_3 = r$, $x_4 = \phi$, $x_5 = \theta$, and $x_6 = \psi$; the model of in state-space form are denoted as
% The state-space model of the experimental setup is given as
\begin{align}\label{eq:diffeq}
		\dot x_1 &= \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}} x_2 x_3 + x_2 \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{rotor}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}}\Omega_r + \dfrac{u_{\text{roll}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{roll}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}} \\
	\dot x_2 &= \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}} x_1 x_3 - x_1 \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{rotor}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}}}\Omega_r + \dfrac{u_{\text{pitch}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{pitch}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}}\\
	\dot x_3 &= \dfrac{\mathrm{I}_{\text{xx}} - \mathrm{I}_{\text{yy}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}} x_1 x_2 + \dfrac{u_{\text{yaw}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}} + \dfrac{d_{\text{yaw}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text{zz}}}\\	
	\dot x_4 &= x_1 + (x_2\sin(x_4) + x_3\cos(x_4))\tan(x_5)
\\
	\dot x_5 &= x_2\cos(x_4) - x_3\sin(x_4)\\
	\dot x_6 &= (x_2\sin(x_4) + x_3\cos(x_4))/\cos(x_5) \label{eq:diffeq-end}
\end{align}
The measurement model is written as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\boldsymbol{\mathrm{z}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
			p_m & q_m & r_m & \phi_m & \theta_m & \psi_m
		\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linear Model}
\noindent The continuous-time linear model is utilized to drive the control commands on the quadrotor. The linear state-space model is denoted as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linear}
	\boldsymbol{\dot{\mathrm{x}}}(t) = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{Ax}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{Bu}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_{d}d}}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A}}$, $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B}}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_d}}$ are the system, input and disturbance matrices, respectively. Moreover, $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{d}}$ is the disturbance. The measurements equation is stated as
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{z}}}(t) = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(t)
\end{equation}


According to Eqs.\eqref{eq:diffeq}-\eqref{eq:diffeq-end}, the linear dynamic model around the equilibrium points $(\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x}}}_e\!=\!0 \text{ and } \boldsymbol{{\mathrm{u}}}_e\!=\!0)$ of the quadrotor setup is denoted as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{\dot x}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{\dot x_{\text{roll}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{\dot x_{\text{pitch}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{\dot x_{\text{yaw}}}}}
		\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{A_{\text{roll}}}}} & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{0}\\
			\boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{{\mathrm{A_{\text{pitch}}}}} & \boldsymbol{0} \\
			\boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{{\mathrm{A_{\text{yaw}}}}}
		\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x_{\text{roll}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x_{\text{pitch}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x_{\text{yaw}}}}}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\\[1em]
		& + \begin{bmatrix}

		\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{d_{\text{roll}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{d_{\text{pitch}}}}}\\
			\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{d_{\text{yaw}}}}}
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}_{\text{roll}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	p & \phi
\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$, $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}_{\text{pitch}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	q & \theta \end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}_{\text{yaw}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	r & \psi
\end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}$.


Moreover, the state and input matrices are presented as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A}}_{\text{roll}}  =\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A}}_{\text{pitch}}  = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{A}}_{\text{yaw}}  = \begin{bmatrix}

	\end{split}
\end{equation}




\section{Formulation of the Controller Design}\label{sec: diff game}

\noindent In the LQIR-DG controller structure, an integral action is added to the LQR-DG controller to cancel the steady-state errors for reference tracking. For this purpose, first, the augmented state space of the linear quadrotor model is defined to utilize in the controller architecture. Then, the LQR-DG controller design procedure is presented to produce the best control commands for the experimental setup of the quadrotor.

\subsection{Augmented State Space Formulation}
\noindent To add the integral action to the controller structure, the augmented states are defined as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{lqidg_x}
    \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_i}} &
        \displaystyle \int \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_i}}
    \end{bmatrix}^\mathrm{T}
\end{equation}
where $i$ = roll, pitch, and yaw.
Then, the quadrotor dynamics model, denoted by Eq.\eqref{eq:linear}, is denoted in the augmented state-space model as

\begin{equation}\label{systemlqidg}
	\begin{split}
		\boldsymbol{\dot{\mathrm{x}}_a}(t) &= \boldsymbol{\mathrm{A_ax_a}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_{{a}}u}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_{{d_a}}d}}(t)%, \quad \boldsymbol{x}(0) = 
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where matrices $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A_a}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_a}}$ are defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A_a}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A}} & \boldsymbol{0}\\
		\boldsymbol{\mathrm{I}} & \boldsymbol{0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_a}} = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_{{d_a}}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B}}\\
		\boldsymbol{0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In the above equation $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{I}}$ denotes the identity matrix.
\subsection{LQIR-DG Controller Method}
\noindent The LQIR-DG controller is an optimal and robust method based on the differential game theory. This controller consists of two essential players: one finds the best control command, and the other creates the worst disturbance. 
For this purpose, the first player tries to minimize a cost function; while the second player is assumed to maximize it. Therefore, the quadratic cost function equation is denoted using min-max operators as follows:
\begin{equation}
	    \begin{split}
		&\min_{u} \max_{d} J(\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}}, {u_i}, {d_i}) = J(\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}}, {u^*_i}, {d^*_i})= \\ & ~~\min_{u} \max_{d}
         \int_{0}^{\mathrm{t_f}}\biggl (\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x^\mathrm{T}_{a_i}}}  \boldsymbol{\mathrm{Q_i}} \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}}+
        {{u^\mathrm{T}_i}}  {{R}} {{u_i}}-
        {{d^\mathrm{T}_{i}}} {{ R_{d} d_{i}}}
        \biggl )\mathrm{d}t
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where ${{ R}}$ and ${{R_{d}}}$ are symmetric nonnegative definite matrices and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Q_i}} $ is a symmetric positive definite matrix.  Moreover, $\mathrm{t_f}$ is the final time. To solve this problem, connections between the general optimal problem and the LQIR problem are considered \cite{LQDG} and consequently the optimum control effort is computed for the each control loop as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		{{u_i}}(t) = -\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K}}_{i}}(t) \boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}}}(t)
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	{{d_i}}(t) = \boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K}}_{i}}(t)\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{x_{a_i}}}}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K_i}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K_{d_i}}}}$ are a time varying gain, given by
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K_i}}} = {{{R}}^{-1}}\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{B}_{a_i}^\mathrm{T}}}\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{P}}_{a_i}}(t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{K_{d_i}}}} = {{{R}}^{-1}_{d}}\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{B}_{a_{d_i}}^\mathrm{T}}}\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{P}}_{a_{d_i}}}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{P}}_{a_i}}(t)$ and $\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{P}}_{a_{d_i}}}(t)$ satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{coupled_riccatti_LQIDG}
        \begin{split}
            \boldsymbol{\dot{\mathrm{P}}_{a_i}}&(t) = -\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A^\mathrm{T}_a}}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t) - \boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A_a}} - \boldsymbol{\mathrm{Q_i}} +\\ &\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_i}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)
        \end{split}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \boldsymbol{\dot{\mathrm{P}}_{a_{d_i}}}&(t) = -\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A^\mathrm{T}_a}}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t) - \boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{A_a}} - \boldsymbol{\mathrm{Q_{i}}} +\\ &\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_{d_i}}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_i}}}(t)\boldsymbol{\mathrm{P_{a_i}}}(t)
        \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_i}}} = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B_{a_i}}}R^{-1}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B}^\mathrm{T}_{a_i}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{S_{a_{d_i}}}} = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{B}_{a_{d_i}}}R_{d}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{B}^\mathrm{T}_{a_{d_i}}}$.
In this study, the steady-state values of the above equations $(\boldsymbol{{\mathrm{P}}} \text{ as } \mathrm{t_f} \to \infty)$ are utilized to generate a feedback control law.

\subsection{Performance of the LQIR-DG Controller}

\noindent Here,
the performance of the LQIR-DG controller is evaluated. The desired and actual outputs, including the roll, pitch, and yaw angles, are compared in \figurename{\ref{fig:result}}. The desired scenario of the simulator is considered as a level flight. These figures show that the attitude outputs of the quadrotor converge to the desired values in less than three seconds. Moreover, \figurename{\ref{fig:omega}} show the angular velocity command of the quadrotor, 
respectively. These results illustrate that the LQIR-DG approach appropriately controls the attitude of the experimental setup of the quadrotor.

\subsection{Comparison with LQR}
\noindent Here, the LQIR-DG controller performance is compared with famous control strategy such as LQR controller method. \figurename{\ref{fig:compare}} compares the quadrotor's desired and actual pitch angle in the presence of these controllers. This results indicates that the LQIR-DG controller can provide high tracking performance, such as good transient response and high rapid convergence relative to LQR controller for pitch angle control of the quadrotor setup.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\noindent In this study, a linear quadratic with integral action based on the differential game theory, called LQIR-DG, was implemented for level attitude control in an experimental setup of a quadrotor. To implement the proposed controller structure, first, an accurate model of the quadrotor was linearized in the state-space form, and then the model parameters were estimated. Next, two players were considered for each of the quadrotor's roll, pitch, and yaw channels. The first player found the best control command for each channel of the setup of a quadrotor based on the mini-maximization of a quadratic criterion; when the second player produced the worst disturbances. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller was investigated in level flight and compared to the LQR controller. The implementation results verify the successful performance of the LQIR-DG method in the level flight of the attitude control for the actual plant.
