Since rotor damages occur frequently, it is essential to improve the attitude estimation and thus ultimately the ability to control a damaged quadcopter. This research is based on a state-of-the-art method that makes it possible to control the quadcopter despite the total failure of a single rotor, where the attitude and position of the quadcopter are provided by an external system. In the present research, a novel attitude estimator called Adaptive Fuzzy Complementary Kalman Filter (AFCKF) has been developed and validated that works independently of any external systems. It is able to estimate the attitude of a quadcopter with one fully damaged rotor while only relying on the on-board MARG (Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Rate Gyroscope) sensors. The AFCKF provides significantly better attitude estimates for flights with a damaged rotor than mainstream filters, estimating the roll and pitch of the quadcopter with an RMS error of less than 1.7 degrees and a variance of less than 2 degrees. The proposed filter also provides accurate yaw estimates despite the fast spinning motion of the damaged quadcopter, and thus outperforms existing methods at the cost of only a small increase in computation. }

An aerial robot consists of a quadcopter and a three degree of freedom manipulator attached to the bottom of the aerial vehicle. The quadcopter-manipulator system can reach otherwise hard-to-reach locations, and the manipulator can perform different tasks. Serial link manipulators have a larger workspace and relatively uncomplicated kinematics. In the proposed system, the manipulator's workspace is constrained due to various factors like the downwash of the drone, torque limits, singular configurations, and mechanical structure. The effect of these factors on the reachable workspace is analytically studied in this work. Based on the constraints, a reachable workspace is derived. Finally, a motion planning algorithm that considers these constraints and generates feasible arm configurations is developed. A minimum acceleration trajectory is then generated to reach a given target location. The proposed motion planning algorithm is implemented on the quadcopter manipulator system's unified dynamics, simulated, and validated in MATLAB and ROS/Gazebo platform. }

	abstract = { View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-1410.vidWith the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the safe operation and navigation of a UAV need to be guaranteed, and this requires a collision avoidance (CA) mechanism for UAVs. The artificial potential field (APF), a widely used CA approach, has some issues like local minima and infeasible trajectory. This paper proposes a novel approach to overcome those drawbacks by combining motion primitives (MP) and the APF. In fact, the MP generates a locally optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory for the given time duration. When the collision checker detects the risk of collision at sample points extracted from the planned trajectory, the best route among re-planned safe path candidates is selected using the APF. It is shown that the proposed approach provides smooth and feasible trajectories without any collision in three different scenarios. }
