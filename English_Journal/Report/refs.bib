The control system is expressed on the special orthogonal group, SO(3), to avoid singularities and ambiguities associated with Euler angles and quaternions respectively. It is also the basis for achieving large angle tracking and complex UAV maneuver. Meanwhile, it greatly reducing the complexity of the controller design via variation-based linearization. And the approach of interval matrix is introduced to solve problems of controller online calculation and reduced control accuracy caused by uncertain parameters in model. The proposed robust H∞ control system can exponential asymptotically follow a desired attitude trajectory in the presence of unstructured bounded disturbances.

ABSTRACT = {Wind disturbances and noise severely affect Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) when monitoring and finding faults in overhead power lines. Accordingly, we propose repetitive learning as a new solution for the problem. In particular, the performance of Iterative Learning Control (ILC) that are based on optimal approaches are examined, namely (i) Gradient-based ILC and (ii) Norm Optimal ILC. When considering the repetitive nature of fault-finding tasks for electrical overhead power lines, this study develops, implements and evaluates optimal ILC algorithms for a UAV model. Moreover, we suggest attempting a learning gain variation on the standard optimal algorithms instead of heuristically selecting from the previous range. The results of both simulations and experiments of gradient-based norm optimal control reveal that the proposed ILC algorithm has not only contributed to good trajectory tracking, but also good convergence speed and the ability to cope with exogenous disturbances such as wind gusts.},

abstract = {In this paper, a compound control strategy is proposed to realize the trajectory tracking task of quadrotors under operating constraints and disturbances. Disturbances caused by model uncertainties, environmental noises, and measurement disturbances are divided into matched disturbances and unmatched ones, which are compensated and suppressed separately by using two control components. The integral sliding mode control component is designed to actively reject the matched disturbances, and the control system is then transformed into an equivalent control system subject to equivalent disturbances only related to the unmatched disturbances. The remaining equivalent disturbances are treated by a robust model predictive control component based on the idea of constraints tightening, which minimizes the tracking error in an optimization framework and takes both state and input constraints into account explicitly. The derived compound control strategy is based on these two control components. Conditions are provided to guarantee the robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the tracking error system. An illustrative example on the quadrotors shows the efficiency and robustness of this compound tracking control algorithm.}

As the quadrotor UAV equips with a complex dynamic is difficult to be model accurately, a model free reinforcement learning scheme is designed. Due to the practical limitation of actuators, the end of controller is constrained with a bounded function. In order to reduce the calculation consumption for the onboard computer, an event-triggered mechanism is developed, which only update the controller when the triggered condition is satisfied. The proposed controller is implemented with two neural networks which are called critic and actor. Some advanced RL technologies are utilized for speeding up the train process, e.g. off-policy training, experience replay, etc. The stability of closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov analysis. The simulation results including a stability task and a tracking task verify the theoretical analysis, in which we find the updating frequency of controller is decreased greatly.}

To this end, the overall dynamics of the quadrotor is expressed as a decentralized Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model interconnected with each other. Although the proposed decentralized control technique divides the overall UAV control system into attitude and position subsystems, the stability of the entire control system is guaranteed. Besides, in this paper, the model uncertainty, interconnection, and reference trajectory are considered as disturbances acting on the tracking error. To attenuate these disturbances, a novel sampled-data tracking control design technique is derived based on a linear reference model to be tracked and the time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF). By doing so, both the stability of the tracking error dynamics and the minimization of tracking performance are guaranteed. Also, the proposed tracking control design method is derived as a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based optimal problem. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design methodology.}

In the proposed scheme, the quadrotor position is controlled by a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller, while the orientation control is achieved through a model-based controller. The proposed controller is combined with a power reduction methodology, which includes a controller-gains tuning stage using the cuckoo search algorithm, and a minimum jerk trajectory design stage. The performance of the new controller is assessed in a free-disturbance case and under the effect of parametric uncertainty and aero-dynamical disturbances. The new controller is compared against two linear PID controllers and a nonlinear sliding mode-based controller. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme as well as its robustness against different types of perturbations. Also, it is proven that the power demanded by any controller is reduced when using the power reduction methodology.}

A new robust nonlinear adaptive controller is proposed for orientation and translation tracking by using the Adaptive Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding-Mode Control (ANFTSMC) algorithms. The ANFTSM control law: (i) ensures fast convergence, i.e. the quadrotor outputs achieve to the original values in a short finite-time; (ii) avoids singularities; (iii) solves the chattering effect; (iv) offers robustness against the unknown external disturbances and uncertainties. Furthermore, the system unknown uncertainty and external disturbances upper bound are coped by the proposed control approach. Online estimation of these upper bounds is only introduced by velocity and position measurements. In addition, the control law applies the Lyapunov theory, guarantees the closed-loop stability of the quadrotor system. Finally, various simulations under different scenarios in terms of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties are carried out to evaluate/emphasize the effectiveness of the ANFTSMC strategy proposed in this work. Moreover, a comparative study is accomplished at the end of the present paper and shows clearly the outperformance of the proposed control scheme.}

	abstract = {The stability of formation flight is not only sensitive to external disturbances but also to data observed and transferred between sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A multi-constrained model predictive control (MPC) strategy, combined with Kalman-consensus filter (KCF) and fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDOB) is developed for the formation control of multiple quadrotors here Firstly, KCF is used to effectively fuse the data shared in the formation with noise and uncertainty, which improves the applicability and robustness of the formation in complex environments. Secondly, FTDOB is able to estimate the external disturbances suffered by the quadrotor in a fixed time and provides real-time compensation for the controller. On this basis, an improved MPC (IMPC) is designed for each UAV of the formation, which improves the computational efficiency while ensuring the asymptotic stability of the system. Eventually, the capability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified by simulation in terms of disturbance rejection and noise suppression, as well as good trajectory tracking of the formation.}

	abstract = {In the practical applications, the mass of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) would be time-varying. This time-varying mass will deteriorate the control performance of UAV. To solve this challenge, the mathematical modeling problem of a quadrotor UAV with time-varying mass is first investigated in this paper. The nonlinear dynamics describing the six-degrees-of-freedom full motion is established. Based on the established model, taking attitude tracking control problem into consideration, a robust control scheme is then designed via the sliding mode control theory. Applying the developed proposed approach, the desired trajectory is followed with the attitude tracking error asymptotically stabilized. The proposed controller has the capability of rejecting the external disturbance and the uncertainties induced by the time-varying mass. The feasibility of the established model and the effectiveness of the presented control approach are validated through a simulation study.}

abstract="A new method for global minimization of continuous functions has been proposed based on Ant Colony Optimization. In contrast with the previous researches on continuous ant-based methods, the proposed scheme is purely pheromone-based. The algorithm has been applied to several standard test functions and the results are compared with those of two other meta-heuristics. The overall results are compatible, in good agreement and in some cases even better than the two other methods. In addition the proposed algorithm is much simpler, which is mainly due to its simpler structure. Also it has fewer control parameters, which makes the parameter settings process easier than many other methods.",

abstract = {Model uncertainties, unknown disturbances, and sensors measurement noises affect the attitude tracking control performance of quadrotors. In this article, a novel robust adaptive recursive sliding mode control (ARSMC) strategy is proposed for the quadrotor to improve the attitude tracking performance and disturbance rejection. Firstly, recursive sliding mode control is introduced, including a two-layer sliding surface, an integral sliding surface, and a fast nonsingular terminal sliding surface, which are recursive. Both sliding surfaces converge to zero in turn. And the initial value of the integral sliding surface is designed to eliminate the reaching phase. Besides, the adaptive gain adjustment method is presented to make an estimate of the unknown upper bound of disturbances. It is proved that the attitude control system has the finite-time convergence and the attitude tracking error will converge to zero. A quadrotor attitude test platform is built to evaluate the proposed algorithm. For comparison, twisting controller (TC), cascade PID, and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithms are introduced. Ultimately, the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are verified by simulation and experimental results.}

Fixed-time convergence control of the UAV's attitude tracking errors under the effects of model uncertainties and unknown external disturbances is achieved by utilizing the proposed control design. Actor–critic (AC) structure based neural networks are trained only with the information of the UAV's inputs and outputs data, to handle the UAV's modeling uncertainties with bounded estimation error. Then a sliding-mode based fixed-time controller is designed to compensate the approximation error of the neural networks and the unknown external disturbances. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is presented. The performance of the presented nonlinear robust control strategy is validated through the real-time flight experiments.}

abstract = {The present paper is concerned with the wayset-based guidance of underactuated multirotor aerial vehicles (MAVs). A hierarchical guidance and control structure is first established, in which the guidance is realized as a supervisory loop. The lower-level stabilizing attitude and position control laws are assumed to be available. On the other hand, the outer-loop guidance is designed based on a fixed-horizon tube-based robust model predictive control (MPC), which conducts the MAV to visit a given sequence of waysets, without violating their state and control bounds, and allowing the vehicle to rest in each wayset for a specified period. The MPC is designed using a reduced-order closed-loop dynamic model describing the vehicle's translation, which is derived considering the stabilizing position and attitude control laws and the assumption of a time-scale separation between the closed-loop translational and rotational dynamics. This model is put into a discrete-time linear state-space representation subject to additive bounded random disturbance and measurement noise. The properties of the proposed method, which includes the MPC recursive feasibility and robust stability as well as the overall guidance feasibility, are analytically studied. The method is also numerically evaluated using a realistic quadrotor dynamic model, showing its effectiveness and confirming its properties.}

abstract = {This work presents a bond graph (BG) model and a robust cascaded controller for a twin-rotor system (TRS). The BG model accounts for all the energetic and dynamical couplings. An adaptive integral backstepping sliding mode (AIBSM) controller is used in the outer loop to control the slow yaw and pitch dynamics of the mechanical sub-system whereas a higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer-based super-twisting algorithm (STA) controller is used in the inner loop to control the fast electromechanical actuator dynamics. The gain of the discontinuous control term of the integral backstepping sliding mode (IBSM) controller is adjusted by using an adaptive switching gain law, where the adaptive gain decreases or increases as the system state variables move closer to or away from a sliding surface; thereby reducing chatter and discontinuities near the sliding manifold, and ensuring a nearly smooth reference signal to the inner-loop controller. The unavailable states are estimated by using an unscented Kalman filter. All the used controllers are shown to be Lyapunov stable. The performance of the developed controller is validated through simulation and experiment, and it is further compared with other existing robust controllers. The proposed controller is robust against un-modeled dynamics and external disturbances, and it performs better, in terms of trajectory tracking error and disturbance rejection, than presently existing controllers for the TRS.}

The proposed approach is based on a super-twisting extended state observer (ESO) and a fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FONTSM) with a switching-type reaching law. The novel hybrid control scheme exhibits the following advantageous characteristics. First, the extended state observer injected with a super-twisting algorithm is capable of simultaneously estimating the friction and other nonlinear disturbances without detailed knowledge of the precise friction and disturbance models. Second, the FONTSM surface enhances the control accuracy and robustness, and provides a more flexible controller structure than its integer counterpart. Third, a novel switching-type reaching law is utilized to achieve fast response, constraining chattering in the system. Additionally, the finite-time convergence of the adopted ESO and the finite-time stability of the control system are demonstrated based on the rigorous Lyapunov criteria. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control scheme is demonstrated for an electro-optical tracking system via trajectory tracking experiments.}

This study introduces a new platform for ACMSs in which a quadrotor is equipped with a tendon-bent concentric tube continuum robot. The decoupled dynamic modeling of ACMSs is utilized to derive the proposed feedback control law. The control design process is split into two distinct control loops. In the first loop, a terminal synergetic controller is presented to control the continuum robot's tip to track the desired trajectory. In the second loop, an improved synergetic controller is introduced to control the position and velocity of the quadrotor, which ensures asymptotic stability of the origin of the error dynamic. Moreover, in this loop a hybrid feedback law is designed to operate with the improved synergetic controller, which overcomes topological obstructions and globally stabilizes the attitude of the quadrotor. Furthermore, the stability of the resultant closed-loop system is verified utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The efficiency and advantages of the proposed controller are verified by a comparative analysis in simulations.}

Next, a reinforcement learning-based USV control strategy is proposed, which could learn a motion control policy with an enhanced ability to reject wave disturbances. The simulation experiment results show that the proposed visual navigation architecture can provide stable and accurate position and heading angle estimation in different weather and lighting conditions. The trained control policy also demonstrates satisfactory USV control ability under wave disturbances.}
